# zkSNARK Multiplier 

## Description
We have some public known number C. We want to prove that we know A, B, such that A * B = C, without revealing it.

## How that works
Implemented in Rust, it works using Groth16 proving system (arkworks-rs/groth16). Verifier implemented as a smart-contract on NEAR Protocol. And proofs can be generated using CLI.

- [x] CLI
- [x] Smart-contract

## Usage
